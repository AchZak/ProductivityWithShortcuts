# Chapter 7 - Finding/Buffer
Eventhough this is a small chapter, I thought it was worth including because it helps introduce the next chapter on Multicursors a little bit better.

## Find word and add to buffer `ctrl+F3`
Let's open `WOTW.md` with `ctrl+shift+n` and look for the word _Martians_ in the first sentence.

Select this word (`ctrl+w`) and press `ctrl+F3` once. Now the word _Martians_ has been added to our _Find Buffer_ and we can find the next occurrence by pressing `F3`.

## Find next/previous occurrence from buffer `F3`/`shift+F3`

What happens when you keep on pressing `F3`?

What happens when you keep on pressing `shift+F3`?

Open `War.java`, position your cursor on `13:33` with `ctrl+g`. Select the `.` and press `ctrl+F3`.

Find the next `.`.
