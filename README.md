## What you'll learn
* Increase your productivity by using shortcuts. We'll use IntelliJ on windows as an example.
* Think along with your pair, who's already proficient in using shortcuts.
* In what situations/patterns shortcuts are helpful.
* Some patterns for multi-cursor usage.

## How you'll learn
By doing! The only way to get shortcuts in your fingers is by using them. All. The. Time.

This repo provides a structured aproach to learn with exercises that will help you move forward.

### A little note on the chapters
Eventhough the progression in these chapters might seem to be naturally increasing in difficulty, you don't need to think of them as thresholds.
The only reason there are chapters is to help your brain make paths even better by trying to categorize certain types of shortcuts so you'll think of them sooner in real life.

## Good Luck, Have Fun!
If you like these exercises, share 'em with your friends and colleagues.

GLHF!
