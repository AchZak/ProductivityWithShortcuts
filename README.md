# Chapter 5 - Embedded Windows
IntelliJ has various _Tool Windows_, like the `1: Project` window, `9: Version Control` window, or `3: Find` window. When one of these _embedded_ windows have focus, other shortcuts are available.

In this topic we'll talk about some of them.

## Opening/Closing (Toggling) `alt+number` `ctrl+F4`
All of these windows are accessible by holding down `alt` and pressing the associating number.
e.g. If you want to open or close the `1: Project` window, you press `alt+1`.

## Switching tabs `alt+left,right`
Some of these windows have multiple tabs in them, i.e. the `6: TODO` window. So let's open that with `alt+6`.

You'll notice that it contains the _Project_, _Current File_, _Scope Based_ and _Default Changelist_ tabs.

You can switch between these tabs by pressing `alt+right` and `alt+left`.

## Why resizing is for dummies `ctrl+shift+F12`

## Navigation from Embedded Windows `ctrl+enter` vs. `F4`
