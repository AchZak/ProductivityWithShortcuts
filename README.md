# Chapter 4 - Line Editing
##Duplicate line `ctrl+d`
Open `Chapter4.java`, move your cursor to line 6, press `ctrl+d`.

##Yank `ctrl+y`
Press `ctrl+y` repeatedly to delete the lines.

##Moving lines with and without constraints `ctrl+shift+up,down` vs. `alt+shift+up,down`
Right now in `Chapter4.java`, the `System.out.println`'s are switched around.

Place your cursor on one of the `System.out.println`'s, hold down `alt+shift` and press `up` or `down` to move that line.

Do the same for the other line.

Now the methods aren't in order yet, so place your cursor on `_2_snarf`'s method signature, but this time hold down `ctrl+shift` and press `up` or `down` to move the entire method.

##Start new line `shift+enter`
In `Chapter4.java`, go to 20:20. From this position we want to start implementing the methods body.

Typically, one would do this by pressing `end`, and then `enter`. But you can do this in one go by pressing `shift+enter`, so let's do just that.

It'll come in handy later.

##Join lines `ctrl+shift+j`
