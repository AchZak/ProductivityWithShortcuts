# Chapter 4 - Line Editing
##Duplicate line ctrl+d
Open `Chapter4.java`, move your cursor to line 6, press `ctrl+d`.

##Yank ctrl+y
Press `ctrl+y` repeatedly to delete the lines.

##Moving lines with and without constraints ctrl+shift+up,down vs. alt+shift+up,down
Right now in `Chapter4.java`, the `System.out.println`'s are switched around.

Place your cursor on one of the `System.out.println`'s, hold down `alt+shift` and press `up` or `down` to move that line.

Do the same for the other line.

Now the methods aren't in order yet, so place your cursor on `_2_snarf`'s method signature, but this time hold down `ctrl+shift` and press `up` or `down` to move the entire method.

##Start new line ctrl+enter


##Join lines ctrl+shift+j
