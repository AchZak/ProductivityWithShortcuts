# Chapter 6 - IntelliJ's Suggestions
## IntelliJ's Auto-correct `ctrl+shift+enter`
Sometimes we make mistakes, mistakes that will take us into the deepest pits of bracket hell.

Thank God there's IntelliJ, trying to auto-correct our mistakes.

Let's open (`ctrl+n`) `Chapter6.java`, a class with many mistakes (and (a hell of (a lot of)) brackets).

Let's see what IntelliJ can do for us to fix the mistakes by pressing `F2` to navigate quickly to the first error, and press `ctrl+shift+enter`.

Press `F2` again and let's see if IntelliJ can auto-fill the missing semicolon.

Press `F2` again and see if it can auto-correct an incomplete method.

Undo (`ctrl+z`) your last auto-correct and type out `public void poo(` above the comment line.

It's basically the same thing we tried to auto-correct just a few seconds ago. The only difference is that there are now two "incomplete" error statements.

Try pressing `ctrl+shift+enter` anyways and see what happens.
